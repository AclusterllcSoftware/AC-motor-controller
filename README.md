# AC Motor Controller
The program provides a solution for generating PWM signals with phase and frequency modulation, designed for controlling TRIACs in AC circuits using STM32 microcontrollers.

## Features
- Phase Modulation: Control PWM signal phase.
- Frequency Modulation: Control PWM signal frequency.
- TRIAC Control: Generate PWM signals for TRIACs with adjustable duty cycles and pulse durations.
- Zero-Cross Detection: Adjust for zero-cross detection delays.
